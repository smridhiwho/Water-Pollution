# Water Pollution Detection Tool using Streamlit
This tool employs machine learning models (Keras/CNN) trained on diverse datasets containing images of water bodies under various conditions. The model predicts the probability of a water body being polluted based on the uploaded image. It provides actionable insights based on the classification, aiding in water resource management and conservation efforts.

## Overview
The Water Classification Tool is designed to classify images of water bodies to determine their pollution status. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on various datasets to predict whether the uploaded image represents a polluted or clean water body. The tool offers suggestions and actions to be taken based on the analysis.
